Open the project folder in your favorite code editor.
Locate the package.json file in the root directory.
In the scripts section, you will find a line similar to "start": "react-scripts start".
Modify this line to set the PORT environment variable. For example, to change the port to 5000, use:
"scripts": {
  "start": "set PORT=5000 && react-scripts start"
}
5. Save the package.json file.

6. Run your project using npm start. Your React application should now be running on http://localhost:5000.
